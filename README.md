/*Sustainable System to Mitigate Food Waste in Saudi Arabia*/

* Project Overview
During my internship at Imperial College, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a dedicated team of fellow interns to address Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a project focused on mitigating food waste in Saudi Arabia. Our project aimed to create a sustainable system that would contribute to reducing food waste and promoting responsible consumption.

* Figma Application Design
As part of my role in the project, I leveraged my expertise in computer science and design to develop intuitive and user-friendly application interfaces using Figma. These interfaces were crucial components of our sustainable food waste mitigation system, enabling users to interact with the platform effectively and contribute to our mission.
